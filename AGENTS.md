# Agent instructions

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Read it alongside the per-tool documentation and any memory files the harness loads.

## Commit messages

Draft every commit message in `COMMIT_AGENTMSG` at the repo root before you run `git commit`. A gitignore entry keeps that file out of history, so it serves purely as a scratchpad for iterating on the message. Three steps make up the workflow.

1. Write the full message (subject, body, and trailers) to `COMMIT_AGENTMSG`.
2. Run `just lint-commit-msg` and resolve whatever it reports.
3. Commit the validated draft with `git commit -F COMMIT_AGENTMSG`.

`just lint-commit-msg` mirrors the commit-msg hook: vale under the commit scope (which catches AI commit tells via `ai-tells-commits`), cspell with the commit dictionary, commitlint for the Conventional Commits shape, and commit-trailers for trailer order. Running it while drafting surfaces problems early, rather than at the commit-msg hook where a late failure interrupts the commit.

The prek commit-msg hook on `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` stays the real gate. `COMMIT_AGENTMSG` and its recipe only preview that gate, so a clean recipe run predicts a clean commit but never replaces the hook.

## Coverage pragmas

The branch-coverage gate sits at 100%. A missing branch means a missing test, never a `# pragma: no cover`. Reach for an inline pragma only when a line truly can't run under test and the standing `exclude_also` patterns in `pyproject.toml` don't already cover it. Such a pragma always carries an adjacent comment naming why the line stays unreachable. Reviewers reject a bare `# pragma: no cover` with no such defense, the same way they reject an undocumented lint ignore.
